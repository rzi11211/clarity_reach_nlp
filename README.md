What is Clapping?
Clapping is a way readers can show appreciation for a Medium story and recommend it to their followers. The more you like something, the more you can clap. You can clap up to 50 times per post, and you can clap for as many posts as you want. Clapping plays a role in determining how much an author can earn per story.[*source*](https://medium.com/blogging-guide/how-do-claps-work-on-medium-b2897784ce6b)
